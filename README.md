# Introduction to Operator Overloading
Operator overloading is one of the best features of C++. By overloading the operators, we can give additional meaning to the operators like +-*/=.,= etc., which by default are supposed to work only on standard data types like int, float, char, void etc. It is an essential concept in C++. It’s a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to give it the user-defined meaning.

C++ allows us to specify more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope, which is called function overloading and operator overloading, respectively. The process of selecting the most suitable overloaded function or operator is called overload resolution.

So now let’s understand what is operator overloading in c++.
